				<p>Press <b>P</b> to activate or deactivate the control points. Then, rotate the control knob to choose which control point to manipulate.</p>
				<p>Once you have your control point selected, press <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, or <b>Z</b> to turn on that axis. Then, rotate the control knob to move the point along that axis. You will see the surface update as you adjust the control points.</p>
				<p>Press <b>TUT</b> to try it out now, then press <b>TUT</b> again when you're ready to continue.</p>
